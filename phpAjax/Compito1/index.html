        Fantozzi saga is a group of movies created by 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Villaggio">Paolo Villaggio</a>
        that tell the story of <strong>Ugo Fantozzi</strong>. 
        His role is that of a hapless accountant who is fighting with the vices,
        the tortures and the changes in Italian society. What made the character
        famous is its extravagant exaggeration of customs and habits, in a manner
        so coarse and grotesque that immediately made Fantozzi the representative
        of Italy's lower middle class.
